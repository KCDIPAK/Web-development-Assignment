    	 		<div class="Box2">
    	 			<p>This is my first programming language.Before this I had no idea about programming language. I was so fun to learn this. There were many ups and downs during my journy. It was really headach at begening but when I was use to it, it was really fun.HTML and CSS are basic language of programming, we can play around different CSS properties which is enough to create simple website with different features like Hmaburger icon, forms, etc. As I came to know about online source of HTML and CSS i.e W3SCHOOL,it make my working experience really awesome. There are alot of examples which we can practise and master it.</p>

    	 			<h2>Home Page</h2>
    	 			<p>Home page is the first page of this website where we can see short introduction to me and site purpose.</p>
    	 			<h2>Porfolio Page</h2>
    	 			<p>My second page is Portfolio page.In this page we can see 4 box with dummy image of 300x400. There are some text under that dummy image.Since I have not done any kind of project so that I couldn't place any picture of my works on that box where dummy image is.Those dummy image will be replaced by my work in future and all those text will be replaced by my project work text.</p>
    	 			<h2>CV page</h2>
    	 		      <p>Third page is CV page where there are few detail about myself. Starting from left top cornor there is photo of mine which is in round shape and can be hovered.Beside that there is my name on top which is in upper case and my profession under my name. Those are in box of color code of #0E0044 and height and width of 150px and 87% respectively.</p>
       		    	 <p>Now all my information are divided into 2 part i.e in left and right column. Left column have my address, Phone number, E-mail and about myself where as Right column has Education and skills.As all have page have a botton to another page this page also have a CONTACT ME button. </p>
       		    	 <h2>Contact Page</h2>
       		    	 <p>Contact page is Fourth page. In this page you can contact me by filling up short form. Beside you can directly contact me through my detial provided on Right side of page.</p>
       		    	 <p>
       		    	 	To create this page, two parts were seperated 1 for form and another for detials. With the help of display flex there were lined together.
       		    	 	The color of two boxes are white and blue which matches the background.With the help of HTML color code I was able to select color code.
       		    	 </p>
       		    	 <h2>Overview</h2>
       		    	 <p>All those pages are responsive and is suitable for mobile view too. When this page is switched to Mobile view those navagation menu are hidden and Hamburger Icon is appered.To create Hamburge I took video refrence from youtube which is refrenced below.<br>
       		    	 	Talking about selection of color, First it comes about Navagation bar which is Blue color. As it is my Fav color I it for my navbar and text on it is white which match perfectly.As we can see background color is in linear gradient from left to right.
