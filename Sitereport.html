    	 		<div class="Box2">
    	 			<p>This is my first programming language.Before this I had no idea about programming language. It was so fun to learn this. There were many ups and downs during my journy. It was really headach at begening but when I was use to it, it was really fun.HTML and CSS are basic language of programming, we can play around different CSS properties which is enough to create simple website with different features like Hmaburger icon, forms, etc. As I came to know about online source of HTML and CSS i.e W3SCHOOL,it make my working experience really awesome. There are alot of examples which we can practise and master it.<br>
 
                    There were many rumors about difficulties of learning programming and it was true but after 1-2 weeks of learning and practising sides from univesity it start to become eassy day by day.Everyday giving 1-2 hrs for beginers like me was really important so that you  can face the problems and can find  the solution of those problems. Without facing problem we cant learn any thing so deeply. Facing problem and solving problems are part of life which help me a lot in this sector.

    	 			<h2>Home Page</h2>
    	 			<p>Home page is the first page of this website where we can see short introduction to me and site purpose. We can see a small picture on right side of
						 website. Since it is my personal website I decided to keep my own picture on it.
					 </p>
    	 			<h2>Porfolio Page</h2>
    	 			<p>My second page is Portfolio page.In this page we can see 4 box with dummy image of 300x400. There are some text under that dummy image.Since I have not done any kind of project so that I couldn't place any picture of my works on that box where dummy image is.Those dummy image will be replaced by my work in future and all those text will be replaced by my project work text.</p>
    	 			<h2>CV page</h2>
    	 		      <p>Third page is CV page where there are few detail about myself. Starting from left top cornor there is photo of mine which is in round shape and can be hovered.Beside that there is my name on top which is in upper case and my profession under my name. Those are in box of color code of #0E0044 and height and width of 150px and 87% respectively.</p>
       		    	 <p>Now all my information are divided into 2 part i.e in left and right column. Left column have my address, Phone number, E-mail and about myself where as Right column has Education and skills.As all have page have a botton to another page this page also have a CONTACT ME button. </p>
       		    	 <h2>Contact Page</h2>
       		    	 <p>Contact page is Fourth page. In this page you can contact me by filling up short form. Beside you can directly contact me through my detial provided on Right side of page.</p>
       		    	 <p>
       		    	 	To create this page, two parts were seperated 1 for form and another for detials. With the help of display flex there were lined together.
       		    	 	The color of two boxes are white and blue which matches the background.With the help of HTML color code I was able to select color code.
       		    	 </p>
       		    	 <h2>Overview</h2>
       		    	 <p>All those pages are responsive and is suitable for mobile view too. When this page is switched to Mobile view those navagation menu are hidden and Hamburger Icon is appered.To create Hamburge I took video refrence from youtube which is refrenced below.<br>
       		    	 	Talking about selection of color, First it comes about Navagation bar which is Blue color. As it is my Fav color I it for my navbar and text on it is white which match perfectly.As we can see background color is in linear gradient from left to right.

					    <p>As I have already mentioned that this is my first coding language, it was really fun and awesome to learn. 
					    	There were may lecture slides for our guide which were provided by university. Each slides have tutriols section which helps to gain experience of coding too.
					     	Since every slides were in simple language it was very eassy to understand and were eassy to apply during tutriol section.</p>
					    <p>I have created a simple website after learning this language of coding. To create this website, university guide slides have really helped me alot.
			     		   After 3-4 weeks of learning, I was able to use almost all CSS properties and was able to play around different properties. But there were some difficult topic like creating hamburger icon,
					       which was really tought. To create that icon I took video refrence which I have mention above. <br>
						   After creating website, making it responsive is important task. Every steps to make responsive website were mentioned in slides of university.
						   With the refrence of that slide I learned to make website responsive in all devices too.
