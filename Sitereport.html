    	 			<p>This is my first programming language.Before this I had no idea about programming language. I was so fun to learn this. There were many ups and downs during my journy. It was really headach at begening but when I was use to it, it was really fun.HTML and CSS are basic language of programming, we can play around different CSS properties which is enough to create simple website with different features like Hmaburger icon, forms, etc. As I came to know about online source of HTML and CSS i.e W3SCHOOL,it make my working experience really awesome. There are alot of examples which we can practise and master it.</p>
